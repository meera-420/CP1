      <p> The reason I decided to become an IM practitioner is because I wanted to have diverse studies. The first interactive media class I took turned my whole life around. The class was the reason I decided to become a practicing I'M student. <br> <br>
In all my years as an IM student I realized, I can create anything I can think of.  That is exactly how I approached creating this project.  This project was inspired by my sister and a friend of mine. They are both people I wanted to protect from the dangers of love. <br><br>

A cautionary tale, maybe, but what’s wrong with that ? From my personal experience, these tales are nothing but realities. We never believe that the worst can happen to us even if we are aware of these existing horrors. So why don't we believe that we might be hurt, are we too smart?  Is it that we make better choices? Why are we so above danger? <br> <br>

The point is, we are not. However, we don't really believe that until we experience it. Which led me to wonder, why must we live with scars, pain and most of all regret. Why must the thing “ doesn't kill us make us stronger”. That is why I decided, if humans' stubborn nature has to prevail in the context of danger, then let them have what they ask for… safely. <br><br>

That is why VR was the technology for me. By creating an immersive experience for the audience, it will be as though they have lived the dangers. Being in the environment (Virtually) helps me expose the audience to the danger I target, in this case..love.<br><br>

This Project targets women as the  audience, more specifically women in the middle east. The topic of dating in the middle east lacks guidance making it the only way for women to learn about love is through secretive trial and error. Those secrets have led women down very dark paths, all in the name of love and freedom of love. I bring to light a guide to a topic that people from that region choose to not explore using a series of short films in VR.
