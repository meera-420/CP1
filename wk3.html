    <h1>WEEK THREE : </h1>
    <div class="3">
      <p> For this week, i focused on research as an aim to gather rounded information on women in the middle east. as much as i wanted this project to focus on women in the UAE
      and how they should aim to avoid toxic men. I also wnated women all over the world to be able to relate to the content of this immersive film.
    so i tried to focus my reasearch on general middle eastern women and thier experiances dating men. </p>
